### Game Summary

“LENG” is a surreal vertical arena shooter set in a distorted, bass-heavy world of layered arenas and rhythmic violence.
Climb through stacked levels of abstraction—each higher layer a test of movement, precision, and ego.

Stylized in stark monochrome with bursts of neon, LENG blurs grime and minimalism into a hypnotic flow of speed, spectacle, and sound. Every ascent amplifies the pressure, every drop hits harder.

### Core Gameplay

- **Vertical Layered Arenas**  
  Each arena is built in stacked tiers.  Fight and maneuver your way up by climbing the central pole before time runs out.

- **Climb for Points**  
  Points are awarded in order of ascent. The quicker you reach the next layer, the higher your score.

- **Trick-Heavy Combat**  
  Movement and mechanics mastery define every encounter. Semi-autos, trick-scopes, and speed are your tools of expression.

- **Dynamic Difficulty**  
  Difficulty scales through consequences. Fail to meet your daily goals, and you'll spiral into harsher penalties and weirder realities.

- **Session-Based Play**
  Host custom matches with selectable arena counts (1, 3, 6, or 9 layers), and control how long the climb lasts. Each session builds momentum, distortion, and spectacle as you rise.
