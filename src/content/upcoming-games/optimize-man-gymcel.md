### Game Summary

“OptimizeMan: Gymcel” is a psychological horror/satire gym-sim survival game that delves into the absurdities of toxic self-improvement culture, mental health struggles, and internet subcultures.  The game navigates the journey of OptimizeMan, a young anonymous figure caught in a loop of radical self-improvement, attempting to balance personal growth and emotional stability.

Mechanically inspired by titles like **Don't Starve** and **Pathologic**, but with a faster pace and more reactive. Grotesque deformations, injuries, audio shifts, and achievements keep the pressure vivid and the feedback immediate.
