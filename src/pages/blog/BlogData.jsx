`Maori architecture is rooted in the relationship between people and the natural environment, characterized by the use of local and sustainable materials amongst a flexible design that adapts to changes in weather. In modern times, the incorporation of Maori design principles in new developments, such as natural and sustainable materials, environmental respect and Maori symbolism can reignite a sense of peaceful identity and culture for our country, while promoting sustainable and eco-friendly building practices (Ratana, 2021).

Natural building materials such as mycelium, a material created from fungi, will be an excellent way to honor and protect our culture and environment while building sustainable structures. Mycelium is biodegradable, fire-resistant, has strong insulation properties, and can can be grown quickly and inexpensively; a promising alternative to more conventional building materials (Javadian, Le Ferrand, Hebel, Saeidi, 2019). The incorporation of natural materials and designprinciples from traditional Maori architecture, along with innovative technologies like mycelium, can create a culturally rich, sustainable, and ecological urban spaces. The use of mycelium in building can be seen as a way to reform a harmony with our natural environment, in our expanding cities and towns. By using a material that is grown from fungi, builders are acknowledging the importance of the interconnectedness of all living things.

Incorporating Maori Knowledge and science in the development of sustainable building practices can enhance Masseyâ€™s climate action response in the buildings and energy sector. By combining traditional Maori design principles and knowledge of sustainable materials with modern scietific techniques, we can create innovative, sustainable and eco-friendly building solutions that are grounded in shared environmental and cultural values. The fusion of Matauranga Maori traditional and modern scientific practices is proactive and advantageous for a much-needed prosperous future of our country. Providing opportunities for knowledge-sharing and collaboration between different communities and areas of expertise.

The wider context of sustainability in relation to buildings and energy involves considering the social, economic, and environmental impacts that much construction and energy use has on our society. We live in a society. Sustianable building practices should cultivate economic prosperity, and minimize environmental harm. This includes reducing carbon emissions, minimizing waste, using renewable energy sources. Pushing forth with new innovate technology and materials such as mycelium fulfils this with the concept of bio-degradable building materials and cities. Neo-traditional approaches to building can play a crucial role in ensuring a sustainable future for our communities.`,
